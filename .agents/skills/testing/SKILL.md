  desc: Backfill safety-net tests
  summary: Add focused tests around existing code before changing it. Characterizes current behavior, finds coverage gaps, and creates a safety net for refactors or risky fixes.
  what: |
    Testing is for old or under-tested code that needs a safety net before you touch it. It discovers the public behavior, runs the current suite, identifies the riskiest gaps, then adds focused characterization tests one vertical slice at a time. It can use unit, integration, and E2E tests, but only where they protect real behavior.
  why: |
    New feature work already belongs in /arc:implement and its TDD loop. This skill brings something different: it makes existing behavior observable before refactoring or changing fragile code, so you know whether later edits preserved behavior or intentionally changed it.
  decisions:
    - This is not the default path for new feature TDD. Use /arc:implement, $tdd, or superpowers:test-driven-development for that.
    - Characterize through public interfaces first. Tests should protect behavior users or callers can observe.
    - Add tests in vertical slices. Avoid broad horizontal plans that write every test outline before proving any one behavior.
    - Use the smallest useful test level. Prefer unit or integration tests unless only an E2E flow proves the risk.
    - Existing behavior tests may pass immediately; prove they are sensitive before trusting them.

# MANDATORY Tool Restrictions

## REQUIRED TOOLS — use these when indicated:
- **`AskUserQuestion`** — Preserve the one-question-at-a-time interaction pattern. In Claude Code, use the tool. In Codex, ask one concise plain-text question at a time unless a structured question tool is actually available in the current mode. Do not narrate missing tools or fallbacks to the user.

## BANNED TOOLS — calling these is a skill violation:
- **`EnterPlanMode`** — BANNED. Do NOT call this tool. This skill has its own structured testing workflow. Execute it directly.
- **`ExitPlanMode`** — BANNED. You are never in plan mode.
</tool_restrictions>

<arc_runtime>
This workflow requires the full Arc bundle, not a prompts-only install.

Paths in this skill use these conventions:
- `agents/...`, `references/...`, `disciplines/...`, `templates/...`, `scripts/...`, `rules/...`, `skills/<name>/...` are Arc-owned files at the plugin root. Resolve the plugin root from this skill's filesystem location — it's the directory containing `agents/` and `skills/`.
- `./...` is local to this skill's directory.
- `.ruler/...`, `docs/...`, `src/...`, or any project-relative path refers to the user's project repository.
</arc_runtime>

# Characterization Testing Workflow

Backfill focused tests around existing code before a risky change. The goal is not "more tests" in the abstract; it is a trustworthy safety net around behavior that must survive a refactor, migration, or bug fix.

Use this skill when:
- Existing code has little or no test coverage.
- A refactor needs a behavior-preserving safety net first.
- A god file, duplicated implementation, or tangled module needs characterization before decomposition.
- A performance optimization needs current behavior pinned before changing data structures, batching, memoization, caching, or ordering.
- A bug fix touches unclear behavior and you need to capture the current contract before changing it.
- Coverage reports show gaps around important public behavior.
- Auth, API, state, or browser flows need targeted tests before launch or audit remediation.

Do not use this skill as the normal new-feature workflow. For new work, use `/arc:implement` or a dedicated TDD skill so RED/GREEN/REFACTOR remains the governing loop.

## Agents

Use specialist agents only when the slice is large enough to justify delegation:

| Agent | Model | Purpose | Framework |
|-------|-------|---------|-----------|
| `unit-test-writer` | sonnet | Characterize pure functions, hooks, or isolated components | vitest |
| `integration-test-writer` | sonnet | Characterize API, auth, state, and component integration behavior | vitest + MSW |
| `e2e-test-writer` | opus | Characterize critical browser journeys | Playwright |
| `test-runner` | haiku | Run unit/integration suites and analyze failures | vitest |
| `e2e-runner` | opus | Run Playwright, inspect screenshots/traces, iterate on failures | Playwright |

<rules_context>
**Check for project testing rules:**

**Use Glob tool:** `.ruler/testing.md`

If it exists, read it for MUST/SHOULD/NEVER constraints.

**Detect test framework:**

| File | Framework |
|------|-----------|
| `vitest.config.*` | vitest |
| `jest.config.*` | jest |
| `playwright.config.*` | Playwright |
| `package.json` scripts | Project-specific test commands |
</rules_context>

## Process

### Step 1: Confirm The Safety-Net Target

Ask one question only if the target is unclear:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What existing code or behavior needs a safety net before we change it?"
  header: "Test Target"
```

Then identify:
- The files, routes, packages, components, or commands involved.
- The planned change or refactor the tests must protect.
- The public interfaces where behavior is observable.
- Any business-critical, auth, persistence, payment, data, or browser-flow risk.
- Any ordering, duplication, identity, mutability, pagination, permission, cache invalidation, or tenant/filtering behavior that an optimization must preserve.

### Step 2: Establish The Baseline

Gather evidence before writing tests:
- Read the target code and nearby tests.
- Read recent commits or plans when they explain the intended behavior.
- Run the smallest existing relevant test command.
- If no test command exists, identify the project’s likely framework and package manager.
- Note current failures separately from new failures.

Do not silently fix production behavior during baseline work. If you discover an obvious bug, capture it as either:
- A current-behavior characterization test if the change is meant to preserve it.
- A failing desired-behavior test if the user is asking for the bug to be fixed.

### Step 3: Map Public Behavior

List behavior in terms of callers or users, not internal implementation details:

```markdown
## Safety Net: [Target]

### Planned Change
- [Refactor / bug fix / migration / cleanup]

### Public Interfaces
- [Function/component/API route/page/CLI command]

### Current Observable Behavior
| Behavior | Evidence | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|
| [behavior] | [code path, existing test, manual observation] | [high/medium/low] |

### Test Slices
| Slice | Level | Why this level |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| [one behavior] | [unit/integration/e2e] | [fastest useful proof] |
```

### Step 4: Add Tests One Vertical Slice At A Time

For each slice:
1. Choose one public behavior.
2. Choose the smallest useful test level.
3. Write the test.
4. Run only the relevant test.
5. Prove the test is sensitive:
   - For current-behavior characterization, the test may pass immediately. Temporarily perturb the assertion, fixture, or input to prove it fails for the right reason, then restore it.
   - For desired behavior or bug fixes, follow RED/GREEN/REFACTOR. Do not change production code before the failing test exists.
6. Commit no temporary mutations.
7. Move to the next slice only after the current slice is trustworthy.

### Step 5: Keep Test Seams Small

If existing code is hard to test:
- Prefer testing through an existing public interface.
- Extract only the smallest seam needed to observe behavior.
- Preserve behavior while extracting.
- Avoid large refactors before the safety net exists.
- Avoid mocking internal modules just to force a unit test.

Mocks are acceptable for true boundaries: network, time, filesystem, database, auth providers, payment providers, and external LLM APIs. Prefer real code inside the project boundary.

### Step 6: Run Scoped Then Broader Verification

Run checks in widening order:
1. The single new test file or test name.
2. The relevant package or feature test suite.
3. The project’s normal test command.
4. E2E only when the risk is browser-level or cross-system.

When E2E output is verbose or flaky, dispatch `e2e-runner` with the exact test file and failure evidence.

### Step 7: Report The Safety Net

End with a concise report:

```markdown
## Safety Net Result

**Target:** [code/feature]
**Reason:** [refactor/bug fix/legacy coverage/launch risk]
**Tests added:** [files]
**Behavior characterized:**
- [behavior]

**Verification:**
- [command] — [pass/fail]

**Remaining risk:**
- [untested behavior or reason it was deferred]

**Ready for next change:** [yes/no]
```

## Choosing Test Level

| Level | Use when | Avoid when |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Unit | Pure functions, deterministic formatting, isolated hooks, small state transitions | Behavior depends on routing, browser, API, auth, or multiple components |
| Integration | Component + state, API routes, auth states, form submissions, data adapters | A single pure function is enough or only a real browser proves it |
| E2E | Critical user journeys, auth flows, checkout/signup, routing/browser behavior | The behavior can be proven faster below the browser |

### Coverage Guidelines

| Feature Type | First Useful Backfill | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------|-------|
| Utility functions | Unit | Cover edge cases and invariants through exported functions |
| UI components | Integration | Prefer user-visible behavior over snapshots |
| Forms | Integration | Add E2E only for critical end-to-end flows |
| API routes | Integration | Exercise request/response behavior and error paths |
| Auth flows | Integration + selective E2E | Mock provider states below browser; use real/browser flow sparingly |
| Checkout/payment | Integration + E2E | Mock external provider below browser; keep one critical browser path |
| LLM integrations | Unit/integration with fixtures | Avoid live calls unless explicitly required |

## Auth Testing Quick Reference

Use this only when auth behavior is part of the safety net.

### Clerk Testing

**Integration tests:**
- Mock `useAuth` and `useUser` hooks.
- Test loading, signed-in, and signed-out states.
- Mock `getToken` for API calls.

**E2E tests:**
- Create `tests/auth.setup.ts` for login flow.
- Store session in `playwright/.auth/user.json`.
- Use `storageState` in `playwright.config.ts`.

**Common issues:**
- Trying to mock `ClerkProvider` instead of hooks.
- Missing the `isLoaded: false` state.
- Hardcoding tokens instead of using a `getToken` mock.

### WorkOS Testing

**Integration tests:**
- Mock `getUser` from `@workos-inc/authkit-nextjs`.
- Test with full user object including `organizationId`, `role`, and `permissions`.
- Test SSO redirect behavior.

**E2E tests:**
- SSO flows are slow; consider a test bypass endpoint.
- Create `/api/auth/test-login` for faster auth in test environments only.
- Store session state after auth.

**Common issues:**
- Missing `organizationId` in org-level features.
- Not testing permission checks.
- SSO redirect timing issues without proper waits.

### Bypass Auth For Speed

For faster E2E tests, create a test-only auth endpoint:

```typescript
// app/api/auth/test-login/route.ts
// ONLY available in test/development
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
    return new Response("Not found", { status: 404 });
  }
  // Create session directly without SSO flow
}
```

## Fail-Fast Configuration

Tests must fail fast. Never:
- Use global timeouts of minutes.
- Add many retries to mask flakiness.
- Use arbitrary sleeps.

**Playwright config:**

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  timeout: 30_000,
  expect: {
    timeout: 5_000,
  },
  use: {
    actionTimeout: 10_000,
  },
});
```
